    As you create and edit services and service offerings in Service Builder,
    various states get assigned and change on the services' way to being
    published (approved). Administrators enable the standard approval flow and
    can even customize it using the subflow option in
    <span class="ph">Workflow Studio</span>.

    <h2 class="title sectiontitle">Standard approval flow</h2>
    <p class="p">
      By default, the approval flow in
      <span class="ph">Service Builder</span> is set to approve services
      automatically.
    </p>
    <div class="p">
      When editing a service or offering in
      <span class="ph">Service Builder</span>, the standard approval flow is as
      follows:
      <ul class="ul" id="service-builder-states__ul_zr3_rdf_2yb">
        <li class="li">
          As you edit a service or offering, it's in a
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Draft</span> state.
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          After you submit your service or offering, it moves into the
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Awaiting approval</span> state.
        </li>
        <li class="li">
          After your service or offering is approved, it moves into the
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Published</span> state.
        </li>
      </ul>
      You can edit (checkout) a service or a single offering, one at a time. You
      can also edit a service without checking out its child offerings — The
      offerings remain in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Published</span> state
      until they’re separately checked out.
    </div>
    <p class="p">
      When you check out an offering to edit it, the offering and its parent
      service both get checked out. The rest of the child offerings of that
      parent service remain in the
      <span class="ph uicontrol">Published</span> state. After you finish
      editing the offering, submit it to the parent service so the offering can
      be republished (offerings are published via the parent service).

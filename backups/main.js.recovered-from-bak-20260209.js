/* Recovered file created automatically from:
   - source (current): main.js (HEAD)
   - last-save backup: main.js.bak-20260209-210258 (truncated / had syntax errors)

   This file is a syntactically-validated reconstruction that
   preserves the backup's content where present and fills the
   missing tail from the current committed `main.js` so the file
   parses cleanly. Do NOT use this as a long-term source of truth
   — instead re-apply desired changes to the original source files
   and rebuild.
